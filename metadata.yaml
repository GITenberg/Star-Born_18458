description: 'When Raf Kurbi''s Terran spaceship burst into unexplored skies of the
  far planet Astra and was immediately made welcome by the natives of a once-mighty
  metropolis, Kurbi was unaware of three vital things: One was that Astra already
  harbored an Earth colony, descended from refugees from the world of the previous
  century. Two was that these men and women were facing the greatest danger of their
  existence from a new outburst of the inhuman fiends who had once tyrannized Astra.
  Three was that the natives who were buying Kurbi''s science know-how were those
  very fiends--and their intentions were implacably deadly for all humans, whether
  Earth born or "Star born."'
